To Create A New Garage, 

1) Enter the folder SPGR

2) Create a folder named whatever you want

3) Create a folder inside that folder named 'Garage'

4) Copy and Paste one of the Garage.ini from another garage

5) if you copy and paste a Garage.ini and you want your garage to be smaller, you need to set AmtCars to the number of vehicles you want in your garage (Min 2, Max 40), then foreach vehicle you need to set the Position (VEHICLE1_POS) and you need to set the heading (VEHICLE1_HEADING)



5) if you are using a new Interior, you will need to first load that interior (Good Luck LOL), you need to set the following variables in the Garage.ini, GARAGEENTERMARKER for the outside marker, GARAGEEXITMARKER  for the Exit marker inside the garage, and the REMOVEMARKER for removing and buying a new vehicle

7) you can customise your garage further with Garage.ini Blip ids can be found here : https://wiki.gtanet.work/index.php?title=Blips

8) Next you need to Copy and Paste all the Slot files from another garage into your Garage folder, if you have a 2 car garage you need Slot1.ini and Slot2.ini, if you have a 10 car Garage, you need Slot1.ini to Slot10.ini 
and so on

9) Now you can test your new Garage




Creating a MultiComplex Garage,

1) Do Steps 1 to 8 for Creating a New Garage, now in Garage folder Create 2 New folders and Call them what you want

2) now you need to copy the slot files you need again (Step 9 in Creating a New Garage), but this time you need to do it for however many folders you have in the Garage folder, so copy and paste your Slot Files you need into each of your folders in Garage

3) go back to Garage.ini and set IsMultiPlex from false to true

4) now you can test your new Garage	


For Creating a Garage & an MultiComplex, you can also use the ingame phone menu, but note that you need to manually set blip color, Marker color, and Owned & Not Owned Blip
